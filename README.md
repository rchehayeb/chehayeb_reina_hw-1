This program runs a tensorflow deep learning code built to predict images of various fashion items. 
It uses an existing dataset to train the model, and this import is built in to the code.
This dataset is split into training and testing partitions.
The model classifies images as one of the following labels: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress,
                                                             Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot
An accuracy score is calculated, and the testing partition is then presented with the predicted 
category and the confidence score of that prediction.
